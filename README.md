This addons originaly born while I was working on [Efecto Mariposa](http://patriciogonzalezvivo.com/butterfly.html "Efecto Mariposa") and I need to do fast GPU image processing throught GLSL Shaders.
Basically they are well-known algorithms re-writed on GLSL version 120 for ARB rectangular textures.
They could be optimized A LOT so feel free to collaborate or add more of them.
